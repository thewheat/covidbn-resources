**Booking of Third Dose** (Source: [GOV.BN Post on 21st December 2021](https://t.me/govbnofficial/4301))

- Starts 22 December 2021 at 12:00 noon via the BruHealth iOS/Android app (update to the newest version) for slots from 23 December 2021
- Third dose via walk-in is still open only to the elderly, pregnant mothers and differently-abled persons.
- Currently, the administration of the third dose or booster dose in Brunei Darussalam is using the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine, subject to stock availability at the vaccination centre. Scientific studies have found that the use of both types of vaccines as a third dose or booster dose are effective and safe to enhance the immunity in the body and provide protection against the COVID-19 infection, regardless of the type of initial vaccine that has been received as the first and second dose.

**Update on Third Dose of Vaccine** (Source: [MoH Press Release 13th December 2021](http://www.moh.gov.bn/Lists/Latest%20news/NewDispForm.aspx?ID=1129))

- Commencing this Friday, 17 December 2021, the third dose will start to be given to individuals aged 18 years and above, and have completed two doses of vaccination provided a period of 3 months has elapsed since the second dose was received, regardless of the type of vaccine that has been received
- The change in this time period is following the assessment of the Vaccination Technical Committee which found that two doses of the COVID-19 vaccination may not provide adequate protection to the Omicron variant and a third dose should be given at least three months after the second dose was received in order to increase the vaccination protection against the threat of the variant.
 - The administration of this third dose is on a walk-in basis at any vaccination centres. Meanwhile, for those wishing to book a third dose via the BruHealth app, bookings will be open at the end of December 2021. Members of the public are encouraged to get the third dose of the COVID-19 vaccine to ensure maximum protection can be obtained.

- Government employees and staff who have not completed the COVID-19 vaccine injection and are allowed to work at the office are required to undergo ART testing every two days

- The approved ART Certification Centres will display the Art Certification Centre Logo sticker to make it easier for the public to identify the centres. 
- Disciplinary action will be taken against any Government employees and staff who are not vaccinated and refuse to perform ART testing as directed.

* * * 

**Delayed Administration of the Vaccine** (Source: [MoH Press Release 6th December 2021](http://www.moh.gov.bn/Lists/Latest%20news/NewDispForm.aspx?ID=1122))
- There are some situations where the administration of the vaccine has to be delayed
- One such situation is that of former COVID-19 patients who have received regeneron while in treatment at the National Isolation Centre where they will only be able to receive the COVID-19 vaccine injections after 90 days of completing the treatment. In this regard, any former patients who are still within 90 days after completing the regeneron treatment and have not been able to receive the COVID-19 vaccine injection are advised to contact the National Isolation Centre during office hours for their Regeneron Treatment Card. The issuance of these cards is to provide confirmation that they are temporarily exempted from the COVID-19 vaccination and these cardholders are allowed to enter premises provided that they comply with the other SOPs
- The cooperation of the public, especially heads of Government departments and owners or managers of premises are expected to allow Regeneron Treatment Cardholders to enter their respective premises once they have complied with the other SOPs. They are also exempted from performing the SARS-CoV-2 test either RT-PCR or Antigen Rapid Test within the 90-day period.

**Commencing 29th November 2021: Blood Tests for 3,000 individuals who have received two-doses** (Source: [MoH Press Release 27th November 2021](http://www.moh.gov.bn/Lists/Latest%20news/NewDispForm.aspx?ID=1112))

- The Ministry of Health in collaboration with Universiti Brunei Darussalam, Duke-NUS Medical School Singapore, and EVYD Technology will conduct a study on the level of neutralising antibodies produced by the COVID-19 vaccine among the population of Brunei Darussalam. This study will be conducted to compare the protective immunity or immunogenicity of the vaccines in which the findings of this study will be able to assist in devising a strategy for the COVID-19 vaccine booster programme and to optimise public health strategies in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic in the Brunei Darussalam. In this regard, commencing Monday, 29 November 2021, a total of 3,000 selected individuals from the population who have fully completed two-doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, that is either with Sinopharm, Oxford-AstraZeneca or Moderna vaccines will be invited via a short messaging service (SMS) to participate and attend for blood tests at the Pengiran Anak Puteri Rashidah Sa'adatul Bolkiah Institute of Health Sciences, Universiti Brunei Darussalam. Participants will also receive a follow-up appointment after they are administered with the booster dose to assess the effects of the additional dose. The selected people are urged to cooperate by participating in this upcoming study.
