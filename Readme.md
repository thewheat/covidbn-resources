## COVID Positive Management
   
(Source: [MoH Press Release 14 February 2022](https://www.moh.gov.bn/Lists/Latest%20news/NewDispForm.aspx?ID=1161))
   
- Management of positive cases in isolation centers will focus on cases in Categories 3, 4 and 5 that require medical treatment only
- Cases in Categories 1 and 2 will be allowed to undergo self-isolation at home
   - Each family or one household will be given a 'health package' that contains necessities such as Antigen Rapid Test (ART) kit, blood oxygen level monitor (oximeter), simple medication and health information leaflets;
   - The Ministry of Health has collaborated with the Ministry of Transport and Infocommunications, the E-Government National Centre (EGNC) and Comquest Sdn. Bhd. namely the operator for Talian Darussalam 123, for the implemantation of tasks such as assessment of the health status of newly confirmed positive COVID-19 cases; monitoring of positive cases undergoing self-isolation at home; and delivery of ART kits and health packages commencing Tuesday, 15 February 2022;
 
- Confirmation of COVID-19 infection status will be extended to the use of ART i.e. not only relying on RT-PCR swab testing alone. However, members of the public who are not close contact to a positive case are required to have two positive ART tests and subsequently register the results of the positive ART test on the portal displayed on the screen now (http://www.moh.gov.bn/ARTreport) or by contacting Talian Darussalam 123;
	- BruHealth "ART" feature has replaced ART Report ([Source: MoH Press Release 26th February 2022](https://www.moh.gov.bn/Lists/Latest%20news/NewDispForm.aspx?ID=1170))
- Contact tracing will focus more on primary contacts, high-risk contacts and other vulnerable groups where these close contacts are required to report their health status through the Self-Assessment Tool in the BruHealth app. The quarantine period for the close contacts has been updated to 5 days where they are required to undergo ART testing on the first day and the fifth day and are only allowed to complete the quarantine if both ART tests are negative. The close contacts can use their own ART kit. However, close contacts who require an ART kit can call Talian Darussalam 123. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister's Office will also issue a Guideline for civil servants who have been given a Red Code in the BruHealth app in the near future. Therefore, other contacts such as secondary contacts are no longer required to undergo quarantine and are advised to monitor their own health status and conduct ART tests if they start to show symptoms of the infection.

 - Meanwhile, the Ministry of Health is collaborating with Unified National Networks Company (UNN) for sending a short message (SMS) to individuals who have been confirmed positive and have a purple BruHealth code starting, Tuesday, February 15 2022. Members of the public are advised to ensure that their phone numbers are updated in their respective Bru-HIMS account.

- Updated the definition of "close contact" or primary contacts as follows (Source: [MoH Press Release 16th February 2022](https://www.moh.gov.bn/Lists/Latest%20news/NewDispForm.aspx?ID=1165))
    - Individuals living in the same household with a positive case.

    - Individuals who interacted face-to-face with a positive case for more than 30 minutes and at a distance of less than 1 meter in an enclosed area or indoors.
    - Be in the same vehicle and sit at close range (no more than two seats) with a positive case for more than 15 minutes.

- If you find out that you are a close contact to a positive case follow the steps below (Source: [MoH press release on 19th February 2022 via GOVBN Telegram Post](https://t.me/govbnofficial/4926))

   - immediately report it in BruHealth that you have been in close contact within the last 2 days
   - perform ART tests and report the ART test results to the portal displayed on the current screen (www.moh.gov.bn/ARTReport/)
   - Members of the public are advised not to wait for the Ministry of Health to contact you as there is a possibility of delays. Let us together bear the responsibility in tackling the spread of the COVID-19 infection
   - Failure to report a positive ART test result to the portal is an offense under the Infectious Diseases Act Chapter 204.

- (Source: [MoH press release on 21st February 2022 via GOVBN Telegram Post](https://t.me/govbnofficial/4964))
	
   - Updated the SOP for monitoring of COVID-19 Positive Cases, i.e. those whose BruHealth code has changed to purple or those who have reported positive ART results on the Ministry's portal. 
   - These cases will receive a short message (SMS) from the Ministry of Health containing instructions for SMS recipients to update their health status through the link provided to enable the Ministry of Health to monitor the health condition of the individual.

   - Updated the definition of First Day (Day 1) for COVID-19 cases and close contacts
	
      - COVID-19 case: BruHealth code changes to purple
      - Close contact: BruHealth code changes to red

   - For contacts with red code and is undergoing isolation, suddenly obtains a positive ART result
	
      - BruHealth code will change to purple after they have uploaded their ART results in the web portal
      - The day resets into the First Day of his or her new isolation period
      - In the event of any delay in changing the BruHealth color code for any case or contact, the individual concerned is advised to be patient and continue to isolate themselves from others.


- (Source: [MoH Press Release on 24 February 2022](https://www.moh.gov.bn/Lists/Latest%20news/NewDispForm.aspx?ID=1169))

    - A new update that will be implemented in the process of monitoring and recovery of COVID-19 patients and close contacts through the BruHealth application which will be launched in the near future. In this update, COVID-19 positive patients and close contacts can submit their ART test results on their BruHealth application on designated days without using the currently available ART Report portal, and the supply of ART for patients and close contacts can also be applied through the BruHealth application. In addition, patients can also submit their self-triage survey during their quarantine period through the BruHealth application to enable the Ministry of Health to manage and monitor patient health better and more efficiently. With this update, BruHealth's color code will also change automatically according to the health reports and ART tests submitted. In the meantime, the public is also advised to constantly update their health status daily to help the Ministry of Health to monitor their health.

- Government's Plan on selling Antigen Rapid Test (ART) kits to the public (Source: [MoH Press Release on 3 March 2022](https://www.moh.gov.bn/Lists/Latest%20news/NewDispForm.aspx?ID=1174))
 
   - Principally, the increase in prices in the market is due to the demand and supply factors caused by the limited supply and there is a high demand around the world. This is also partly driven by changes in Government policy such as in Brunei Darussalam which has started using ART for the confirmation of positive cases since 15 February.
   - To ensure the continuous supply of ART at an affordable price, the Ministry of Health in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance and Economy will start selling ART via online through one of the government-linked company and private clinics.
   - Each pack of ART kit will be sold at a price of $ 3.00 per set and delivery cost will also be charged. The supply and delivery will be conducted within three days from the date of purchase. The start date of the sale, Insya Allah, will be announced as soon as the logistical preparations are completed.
   - Members of the public are advised not to take the opportunity to purchase excessively, but to buy the required amount for personal use or for one family only. The cooperation and patience of the public is also requested while waiting for the delivery to be made.
   - When the sale of ART kits open in the near future, low-income families who receive monthly welfare assistance from the Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports and the Brunei Islamic Religious Council (MUIB) through the National Welfare System can apply for the ART kit through the Department of Community Development (JAPEM) and MUIB. Each person in a family will be given 10 ART kits each without any charge for use for a period of 3 months. The distribution of these ART kits will be done through village heads, JAPEM and agents appointed by the Government.
   - The Government is also making preparations to enable ART kits to be sold through vending machines in the near future. These machines will be placed in strategic places and operated by an appointed private company. ART kits sold on these machines will be sold at a price set by the Government.
   - Meanwhile, members of the public can still buy ART kits that are available in the market. Business owners are advised not to take advantage and raise the selling price arbitrarily. The Ministry of Finance and Economy through the Department of Economic Planning and Statistics (JPES) will constantly monitor the market price for the ART kits from time to time.
   - To ensure the quality of ART kits is in accordance with the set standards, the importation and supply of ART kits must be in line with the list that has been approved by the Ministry of Health. A list of ART kits allowed for sale in Brunei Darussalam can be obtained by visiting the Ministry of Health's website (www.moh.gov.bn).

   - BruHealth epidemic map now usinig residential addresses
   - Context:
      - During the first and second waves, a limited transmission of COVID-19 cases enabled accurate cluster identification
      - As transmission becomes more prevalent during this third wave, determining the original source of infection for a single cluster becomes very difficult. 
      - Therefore, infection chain when transmission is very high in the community is less accurate and complicates the identification of clusters
      - To give a picture of the location of positive cases in the country, epidemic mapping has been done through the BruHealth application which is the identification of hotspots based on the residential addresses of the cases.

- (Source: [MoH Press Release on 23th March 2022 via GOVBN Telegram Post](https://t.me/govbnofficial/5349))
   - Starting from 10 pm on Thursday, 24 March 2022, as follows:
      - **I. Recovery Certificate Feature**: This Recovery Certificate feature is a feature specifically for former COVID-19 cases to confirm that they have completed their quarantine and have recovered from the COVID-19 infection. This certificate is an official digital certificate which is a new feature in the BruHealth application that can be downloaded to be printed as a hardcopy, if required by any party who requires official proof of recovery from the Ministry of Health.
      - **II. ART Feature with QR Code**: The currently available ART feature will be updated to integrate the scannable QR Code on ART kits supplied by
the Ministry of Health. The purpose of this QR Code scan is to ensure that the ART kit used is unique and not used repeatedly by any party, especially for COVID-19 patients who receive the care package; civil servants; guests for official Government events; and inbound travellers. However, this ART feature can still be used to submit ART reports that do not have a QR Code.

- (Source: [MoH Press Release on 24th March 2022 via GOVBN Telegram Post](https://t.me/govbnofficial/5369))
   - Starting from 10 pm on Friday, 25 March 2022, as follows:
	- **I. Update of the Health Protocol for those who test positive for COVID-19** : To make it easier for the public to follow the Health Protocol for COVID-19 cases, the Ministry of Health has summarized the existing Health Protocol as follows:
	   - Only one positive ART is required as a confirmation for a COVID-19 case and when they upload a positive ART result to the BruHealth application, it counts as Day One;
	   - Furthermore, positive cases who are undergoing self-isolation are required to undergo ART testing on Day Six. If the ART result is negative, they will be confirmed as recovered and allowed to end the self-isolation when their BruHealth code turns to green. However, if the ART result is still positive on Day Six, they can repeat the ART test the next day and the following days until the ART result is negative. If the ART result remains positive on Day Ten, they will be confirmed as recovered and allowed to end the self-isolation on Day Eleven automatically. Members of the public are advised to use ART kits that are approved by the Ministry of Health and to use is correctly.
	- **II. Integration of the Overseas COVID-19 Vaccination Records**: COVID-19 vaccination records obtained overseas can now be integrated and updated into the BruHealth application. Members of the public can visit www.healthinfo.gov.bn/travel and complete the application information in the "Overseas COVID-19 Vaccination Records" function. Each application will be reviewed by the Ministry of Health prior to approval.

## AskMOH

### What is the purpose of the Ministry of Health updating the current Health Protocols?
[Source: GOVBN Telegram Post on 20th February 2022](https://t.me/govbnofficial/4948)
- When we first started having COVID we didn't really know what it was about
- As we go along they evolve so the disease profile changes
- Now with Omicron, it is more infectious but mild symptoms and it happens in a short time
- With these changes it allowed us to review all the measures in place so we can lessen quarantine period and use new technology (like ART kits) so it can lessen the burden of the public
- Changes based on what is seen in other countries and scientific findings

### When should members of the public get a PCR test if ART testing is now the default detection tool for COVID-19?
[Source: GOVBN Telegram Post on 20th February 2022](https://t.me/govbnofficial/4949)
- PCR is part of Protocol 1: only for specific groups of people e.g.
   - travelling to a place that requires PCR
   - referred by a doctor (e.g. going for medical procedure thtat requires PCR)
- PCR also for equivocal results e.g. first ART test positive but second one negative. PCR will be the final say if person is COVID positive or not

	
### Are ART test effective in detecting COVID-19?
[Source: GOVBN Telegram Post on 20th February 2022](https://t.me/govbnofficial/4950)
- Before decidinig tot use ART as thte default testing tool made sure backed by scientific evidences
- ART kit is very powerful and certainly the most practical so do not have to queue in line as results come out in a short time
- ART will catch you at the time you are infectious
- PCR can detect small amounts but it may be segments of virus that are no longer infectious
	
### What are the Ministry of Health’s efforts in resolving the change of red code issue for close contacts who are allowed to be discharged?
[Source: GOVBN Telegram Post on 20th February 2022](https://t.me/govbnofficial/4951)
- Context: for close contacts who have had 2 negative ART tests and are discharged but Bruhealth code is still red
- Changing code is done manually
- There is a list that is being processed and there is a backlog
- Working with vendor to automate to clear backlog
- Hopefully to be done by end of the week
	
### What should the management of a premise do if they found their staff to be positive for COVID-19?
[Source: GOVBN Telegram Post on 20th February 2022](https://t.me/govbnofficial/4955)
- Do not panic
- Do not send all workers for PCR, follow new protocols
   - COVID Positive: self-isolate, do ART
   - Close contacts: do ART, segregrate if needed
- Follow definition of close contacts
- Not necessary to 
   - close shop
   - do fogging (using normal disinfection home products is sufficient)
